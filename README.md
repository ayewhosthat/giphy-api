### Summary
I had an unexpectedly hard time at first figuring out what was required of me. It was only after I revisited the Asynchronous Code lesson and refreshed myself on Promises and the .then() and .catch() syntax that I had a clear idea of how to approach this mini-project.
Throughout the project I was not overly concerned with styling, as I was more concerned with making sure that the functionality was there, and that the concepts were fully understood.
